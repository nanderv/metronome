# Format rules
# First (non-commented) line has to supply base bpm. This will be used to scale lengths of bars.
# Comments have to start with a single #, followed by a whitespace character.
# After that, lines can either open scope, close scope, or define rhythm. The order in which lines are parsed to type is in that order.
# Open scope lines can open one scope per line, and can only contain that. All other data will be ignored.
# Close scope lines can close one scope per line, and may, optionally, contain the number of repeats of that scope.
# Rhythm-defining lines. They have three required numbers, and one optional one:
#  Beats
#  Measure
#  BPM
#  Repeats
# Special rules: All non-conforming characters are ignored, and the file will parse, assuming it will still get the correct data on that line.
